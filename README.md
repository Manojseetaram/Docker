 2. Container 
A Docker container is a lightweight, portable box that includes an application and everything it needs to run, such as libraries, tools, and system files. Instead of depending on the operating system of the computer, a container carries its own environment, so the app runs the same everywhere—on your laptop, another person’s computer, a server, or the cloud. Docker uses images as blueprints, and containers are the running versions of those images. This makes containers fast, secure, and easy to share. They start quickly, use fewer resources than virtual machines, and help developers avoid the “it works on my machine” problem by providing a consistent environment for every device.

3. Docker image 
A Docker image is like a blueprint or template that contains everything needed to create a container. It includes your application code, required libraries, system tools, and settings. An image is fixed and cannot change; it is only used to create containers. When you run an image, Docker creates a container from it, which is the actual running environment. You can create many containers from the same image, and they will all behave the same because they come from the same blueprint. Images make it easy to share your application with others, deploy it on servers, or run it in the cloud without worrying about missing dependencies.
